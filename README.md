# BinDec_Converter
My first step into coding!

If you've followed me here from my portfolio, thanks for the interest!
If not, check it out at https://Cyrex.me 

So BinDec Converter and the individual functions I've posted here are all free to do whatever you guys want with 
however I wash my hands of responsiblity if you somehow manage to blow something up with it, not my problem haha

Anyway, thanks for checking it out if you'd like to know more about the design process I followed or the logic behind the way I've built the file,
or you just have something you'd recommend changing drop me a comment and I might much about and drop a step-by-step for Youtube or something.

Cheers, Cyrex
